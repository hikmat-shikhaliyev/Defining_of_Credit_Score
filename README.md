# Defining_of_Credit_Score
This project involves building a credit scoring model using logistic regression. The goal is to predict whether a customer's credit score is poor or not based on various features. The project consists of several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.
# Data Preprocessing
Irrelevant columns like 'ID', 'Name', 'CustomerID', etc., were dropped from the dataset.
Missing values were filled with mean values.
Categorical variables were transformed using weight of evidence (WOE).
Outliers in numerical features were handled using the IQR method.
Multicollinearity was checked using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
# Feature Engineering
Derived features such as 'Score' were created based on the 'CreditScore' column.
Categorical bins were created for numerical features.
Weight of Evidence (WOE) transformation was applied to handle categorical variables.
# Modeling
Logistic regression was used to build the credit scoring model.
The model was trained on the preprocessed data.
# Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using metrics like ROC AUC, Gini coefficient, confusion matrix, and classification report.
The ROC curve was plotted to visualize the model's performance.
# Deployment
The trained model can be deployed for real-time predictions. A test dataset can be passed through the model to predict credit scores for new data points.
# Usage
To use the credit scoring model, follow these steps:
Preprocessing: Prepare your data by following the data preprocessing steps mentioned in the code.
Feature Engineering: Apply the necessary feature engineering techniques as demonstrated in the code.
Model Building: Use logistic regression or load the pre-trained model to make predictions.
# Deployment: 
Deploy the model for real-time predictions using appropriate frameworks.
